While definitely faster and more maneuverable than other heavy 'Mechs, it was criticized by many for being too large, underarmed and underarmored. The armament on the Champion is considered by many to be feeble for its size, especially after losing its advanced technology from the Star League. Carrying an AC/10, a SRM 6, and a pair each of Medium and Small Lasers, the Champion is woefully underarmed for its size.",
