    "Details": "A relatively new design, appearing shortly after the Third Succession Way, the Raven was a revolutionary design in many ways.  Not only was it one of the first original 'Mech designs in centuries, it was also designed to be a light-weight electronic warfare 'Mech.  Its Guardian ECM Suite was meant to emulate the older Star League era designs, but has not lived up to its predecessor.  Unfortunately, this new EW Equipment proved difficult to adapt into other 'Mechs, aside from the Raven that it was designed for.  Only time will tell if the Raven will be the new face of war in this modern era.",

It's unfortunate that the ECM gear is so integrated into the chassis of the RVN-1X, imagine what we could do with this on a larger 'Mech?  I did hear about them doing some experiments with integration on a Cataphract as well, maybe we'll get a hold of one of those!"
